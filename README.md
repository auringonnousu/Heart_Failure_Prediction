*Background*

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. (WHO)[https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases#tab=tab_1]
